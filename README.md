# ProAssignment2
For this assignment in Processing we were told to create a classic game. After much consideration I decided to creat the game pong. Where there is two paddles and two players hit a ball across the screen until one of them misses and the other person get a point.
 This game can alos be played against a CPU and it has many other variations.

To start my assignment I decided to draw out my game, where such things are placed. I had a think about how I  would program some little things like movement and stuff. I decided to change my pong game from a two player game to a one player game. I thought this would be better as tested out a two player game by yourself seemed difficult. So I went with one paddle and bouncing the ball against the walls to gather points.

To start my game the user is brought to the main menu. This menu has the game title and has two buttons. One button PLAY GAME will bring the user into the game. The other button QUIT GAME will let the user leave the program. When the user presses the PLAY GAME button. The user enters the game. The instructions of the game are then displayed on the screen. When the user presses a specific button the game will start. The ball starts by moving away from the user's paddle giving the user time to adjust and get set.

The game is a plain screen, with a paddle on the left side and a ball bouncing around. There is score number in the top left corner. This score counter starts at one as the powerups would all show on the screen if it started at zero.
